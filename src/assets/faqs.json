    "q": "What happens when I buy cats?",
    "a": "When you buy cats, your BNB gets locked into the Sourblock smart contract and rewards you with 8% daily return every day."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I take my initial BNB back?",
    "a": "Over Time! Cats are not bought, Cats are fed and therefore they can't be sold. Once Cats are bought they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of BNB at a starting rate of 8% daily."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much are my fees?",
    "a": "There is a small 1% dev fee in order to pay for marketing costs and developing the Sourblock ecosystem"

  {
    "q": "How is Sourblock sustainable?",
    "a": "Sourblock is sustained by continued community support, just as every other crypto coin, token or project. The difference is that since there is no token, there is no price to dump. As long as BNB is in the contract, there will be rewards!"

  {
    "q": "How to use Sourblock on my phone?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Is it better to feed cats or pet cats?",
    "a": "By design, feeding will be more profitable than petting in the long-term."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do referrals work?",
    "a": "Once your BSC wallet is connected to the BNB Miner website, you will notice your referral address appear at the bottom of the page. When a new user hires miners after clicking your personal referral link, the contract will send a BNB value equal to 12% instantly to your Cats. Be smart, use it to feed cats and build yourself a stream of income."
